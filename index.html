<h1>My journey  </h1>
<p>I am originally from the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. Living in the capital is
     pretty similar to living in other major cities.  There is always some construction 
     and development occurring.  The streets are busy with school children and working adults.
     Most of the guys spent our spare time watching soccer in different establishments 
     across the city. </p>

<h2><u>Addis Ababa Capital of Ethiopia</u></h2>
<p>Addis Ababa is sprawling capital in the highlands bordering the Great Rift Valley, 
    is the country’s commercial and cultural hub. Its National Museum exhibits Ethiopian art, 
    traditional crafts and prehistoric fossils, including replicas of the famous early hominid, 
    "Lucy." The burial place of the 20th-century emperor Haile Selassie, copper-domed Holy 
    Trinity Cathedral, is a neo-baroque architectural landmark.

<h2><u>Lalibela Town in Ethiopia</u></h2>
<p>I visited Lalibela rock-cut churche in 2006. Lalibela is a town in the Amhara region of northern Ethiopia. It's known for its distinctive
    rock-cut churches dating from the 12th and 13th centuries, which are pilgrimage sites for 
     Coptic Christians. Carved out of rock, the subterranean monoliths include huge Bete Medhane 
     Alem, and cross-shaped Bete Giyorgis. Many are joined by tunnels and trenches,
     and some have carved bas-reliefs and colored frescoes inside.

<h2><u>Fasilides castle,Gonder Town in Ethiopia </u> </h2>
<p>I visited Fasilides castle in 2008 .Fasilides castle constructed by King Fasilides made Gondar the seat of his empire in
        1636, he constructed a palace that would eventually sprawl into a large complex,
        as succeessors added their own buildings to the compound.  Set in the heart of what is 
        now one of Ethiopia’s largest cities, the palace complex is a mixture of beautifully-
        preserved period architecture with European and Moorish influences, and rambling ruins. 
        Interestingly, Fasilides’ Castle itself is the best-preserved, with its lower halls, 
        reservoirs and steam-baths, remains of kitchens and stables, and even enclosures for 
        leopards and lions that used to grace the grounds.  The castle is located near the city 
        center.  Its structure is purely made of stone.  Today, Fasilides baths are used for 
        baptism during the Timkat festival, the epiphany, in late January; they are only filled
        with water for the festival.  The castle can be found in Gondar, Amhara region.  
        Fasilides’ Castle is definitely a representation of Ethiopia’s great and rich history.
